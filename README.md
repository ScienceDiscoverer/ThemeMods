# ThemeMods
My take on modifying user interfaces of some of my most used software.

Firefox changes:

* Force minimal tab width to be the same as for the pinned tabs
* Remove 'close tab' button from tabs (I guess they can be displayed when number of tabs are small, but I didn't bother)
* Swap tab favicon margin for Title's padding to ensure uniform shape
* Remove right spacer
* Remove 'all opened tabs' list button
* Invert bookmark and tab favicon (as it was not visible on dark background; this way its possible to change it for custom favicon too)
* Use [Tab Counter Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-counter-plus/) instead of right spacer and set up code to hide it when tabs do not overflow.

I also fixed issues with titlebar min/max/close buttons when using non-standard Windows Theme.
